== Itunes Deduper

It seems a not uncommon scenario for Itunes music collections to get messed up as follows

1. Itunes loses entries from it's library (it's XML index of music files)
2. User drags and drops music collection back onto itunes app to repair the library
3. Itunes makes a second copy of the music files as it updates it's library

I'm sure there are ways of avoiding this problem in the 1st place, but it happens
and this is a simple script to solve the issue of the duplicated files, not the 
duplications in the library.

Because it's written for precisely this scenario, no attempt is made to compare
music files across drectories, only within one directory.

It still needs some work (e.g. directories are hard-coded in the base script).
